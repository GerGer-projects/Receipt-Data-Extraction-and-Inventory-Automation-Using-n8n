This project demonstrates an AI-driven inventory automation system built using n8n, which is hosted locally with Docker and exposed securely with Ngrok. The goal was to automate the extraction of details regarding purchases from receipts (images or PDFs) and log them into a structured Google Sheet for inventory management. This was achieved by integrating the APIs of Telegram, OpenAI, and Google Sheets, creating a seamless end-to-end pipeline that processes receipts, extracts product data, and automatically logs inventory.
